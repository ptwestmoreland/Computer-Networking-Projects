# Computer-Networking-assignments-
This will hold the four machine problem assignments from my computer networking course. It is coded in Java.


1. Calculator.java 
This project is a simple calculator that can add, subtract, or multiply two floating point numbers. The computations should be repeated until the letter Q is entered at the user input prompt. If any invalid input, a character that is not A,S,M,Q, is entered then we should return to the welcome message and reprompt the user for a valid input. The inputs are read in as strings and then converted to floating point values as this is required in the prompt. This is a basic assignment thats purpose is to get our class familiar with java.
